# GitHub Scraper
This is an old project that I created a while back that explores the various methods of scraping a GitHub repository to collect repository versions.  
<b>Standard scrape:</b> scraping each version page independently (Not recommended)  
<b>GitHub API: </b> A much more efficient way of data collection and is perferred. 

# PLEASE NOTE
This is currently a side project and for EDUCATIONAL purposes. This project is currently in no way, shape, or form an ongoing project and was developed as an idea.
